# PDD-DQN
My implementation of the PDD-DQN algorithm. The PDD-DQN is an improvement of the classic DQN. It includes the following improvements:

  * Double Q-learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
  * Dueling Network Architectures (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
  * Prioritized Experience Replay (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
